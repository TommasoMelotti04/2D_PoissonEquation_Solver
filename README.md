# 2D Poisson Equation Solver

**Goal.** Numerical resolution of the 2D Poisson problem using finite difference discretization and different solvers (direct and iterative).

## Overview
This project implements:
- Finite Difference discretization of the Poisson equation in 2D.
- Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- Direct solvers with dense and sparse matrix representations.
- Iterative solvers: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR).
- Analysis of convergence, computational cost, and efficiency.
